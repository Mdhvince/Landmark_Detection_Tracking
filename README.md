# Landmark Detection and Tracking: SLAM
This is a Project done in the purpose of the @Udacity Computer Vision Nanodegree where I implement SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) for a 2 dimensional world! 
Here I combine robot sensor measurements and motions to create a map of an environment from only sensor and motion data gathered by a robot, over time. 
SLAM gives a way to track the location of a robot in the world in real-time and identify the locations of landmarks such as buildings, trees, rocks, and other world features.
